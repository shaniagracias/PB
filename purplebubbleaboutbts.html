Initially, Jungkook left his hometown at a very young age to take part in a talent show for kids and was soon scouted by several entertainment agencies. Like previously mentioned, he ended up signing on with Big Hit after being impressed by RM.He was also the only trainee that was sent to America for dance training prior to their debut. By the time the group did debut, he was just 15 years old.

          As a sense of helplessness looms in every corner of the world, BTS opens themselves up to express their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to overcome all this. The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight. BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future.</font> </p>

In this song, the global superstars find happiness by doing again what they do best: engaging in a perpetual cycle of giving and receiving joy with the world through music and performances.

It also marks BTS’ first song to be released completely in English; having sought a “breakthrough” to overcome a sense of disheartenment from within the new global climate, BTS embarks on a new challenge through “Dynamite.”

        The choreography is edgy and upbeat, with deeply addicting movements that highlight the distinct charms of each BTS member.</font></p><br>

A heartfelt story of BTS and their search for their “real selves”



“MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.

          Bridging fine art and popular art through such initiatives as the global art project CONNECT, BTS and the “Black Swan” art film featuring a modern dance interpretation of the early-release track, BTS is poised to show their latest growth as artist through “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”. </font></p>

  <h2>Love Yourself:Answer</h2>
  <div>
      <p><font size="2">First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.

          ‘ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF ‘ANSWER’ still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers. </font></p>

However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment. </font></p>
